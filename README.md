##Algorithms and Abstract Data Types
##Winter 2017

###Studies basic algorithms and their relationships to common abstract data types. Covers the
notions of abstract data types and the distinction between an abstract data type and an implementation of
that data type. The complexity analysis of common algorithms using asymptotic (big O) notation is
emphasized. Topics include sorting and searching techniques, basic graph algorithms, and algorithm design
techniques. Abstract data types covered include priority queues, dictio
